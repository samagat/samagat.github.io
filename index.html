                    Christopher Statton is an artist, arts administrator, and community activist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Working hands on within the social justice and arts communities for over a decade, Statton served as Executive Director of San Francisco’s Roxie Theater from 2010 through 2013. Currently, Statton serves as co-director of Clarion Alley Mural Project (CAMP). Statton has collaborated or individually painted seven murals on The Alley and three off site projects in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. As a community organizer and activist, Statton co-founded Better Homes and Gardens Today with collaborator Megan Wilson and in 2007 co-founded Sidewalk Sideshow, both projects working directly with or through organizations serving the street communities and people experiencing homelessness. In 2013, Statton was the recipient of The San Francisco Film Critic Circle’s Marlon Riggs Award for courage and vision in the Bay Area film community and received The San Francisco’s Board of Supervisor’s Certificate of Honor, sponsored by District 9 Supervisor David Campos. An alumnus of the postgraduate Organizational Leadership program at The Saïd Business School at Oxford University, Statton is now a member of the leaderless San Francisco Poster Syndicate.
