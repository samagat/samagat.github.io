                    Historically, the best comedy comes from poking fun at those in power. Comedy is the voice of the underdog. The films of Preston Sturges commonly used the wealthy ‘elites’ as comic foils. While it would be difficult to animate a ten second story that had enough complexity for a comic foil, I still wanted to show the underdog winning in the end.
